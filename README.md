# Conways Game of life with raylib!
First Raylib project and wanted to see how easy it was to work with.

# Building
Use make to compile.

Refer to: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib on linking and compiling with this project

# Changing grid
To edit the size of squares/array use the defines in main.c
```c
#define SQUARESIZE 1  // defines the height and width of each pixel
#define HEIGHT 1080  // defines the height of the game array which is automatically converted to a window size
#define WIDTH 1920  // defines the width of the game aarray which is converted into a window size
```
